1. my_data: 56 34 12 ff 00 cd ab cd ab

2. a. The program calculates the absolute difference between consecutive elements of an array. The final value of [d] is 115. It is the sum of all of the absolute differences of the consecutive elements of arr. 

   b. It knows when its reached the end of the loop when cmp edx, 0 is true because the last element of arr is 0

   c. The size is 2 bytes because the values are defined by dw which uses 2 bytes

   d. The size is 4 bytes because it is defined by dd which uses 4 bytes

   e. The size of the array is 10 bytes because it has 5 elements that are 2 bytes each

   f. It checks the sign bit of eax. If eax is positive, the program proceeds. If eax is negative, it calculates the twos complement of eax which is the negation.

   g. If edx is not assigned 0, its value would be unpredictable. This is bad because we are using it to accumulate all the absolute differences.
