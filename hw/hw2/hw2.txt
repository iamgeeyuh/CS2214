5. x ^ 2

6. x & ~(1U << 4)

7. (x & 7) | ((x & 7) << 3) | ((x & 7) << 6)

8. (x & 288) == (9U << 5)

9. Rupert is incorrect. Suppose you have x = 4 and y = 3. Then x && y is 1 because x 
   and y are nonzero. Thus they are true and (true && true) results in true, or 1. 
   However x & y would result in 0 since x = 3'b100 and y = 3'b011. 101 & 011 results
   in 0. This shows that && and & are not interchangeable because they result in 
   different answers for the same expression.
