1. What are the initial values of the registers, the program counter, and the memory cells?
registers = 0, pc = 0, memory cells = instructions and 0

2. What should happen if a program sets a register to a value outside of the range expressible as a 16-bit unsigned number? Consider both positive and negative numbers that cannot be expressed in 16 bits.

3. What should happen if a program tries to change the value of $0?
nothing

4. What should happen if a program uses slt to compare a negative number to a positive number?
compares the unsigned, so negative will probably be bigger

5. What range of memory address are valid? What should happen if a program tries to read or write a memory cell whose address is outside of the range of valid addresses?
0 to 2^13. It will read the 13 least significant bits

6. What should happen if a program sets the program counter to a value outside of the range of valid addresses?
It will read the 13 least significant bits

7. What should happen if a program uses a negative immediate value in addi or jeq?
It is represented as unsigned

8. What should happen if a program uses a negative immediate value in lw or sw?
It is represented as unsigned

9. What should happen if a program modifies a memory cell containing machine code?
The modified cell has new machine code

10. What should happen if the program counter reaches the address of the last memory cell?
It wraps back to pc 0

11. When should your simulator stop?
When it encounters halt in machine code
